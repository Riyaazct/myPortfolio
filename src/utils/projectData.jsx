        "Our final project for an NGO partner was a collaborative
        effort involving a team of 7, including 4 full-stack
        developers (students), a front-end and backend tech lead, and
        a scrum master (volunteers). We diligently followed agile
        methodologies to ensure project success. I took responsibility
        for hosting the website on my GitHub repository. This role
        also involved efficiently managing merge conflicts,
        particularly during the initial learning phase of GitHub
        collaboration. I played a vital role in developing several key
        pages, including the 'About Us' page and all its' contents and
        the 'Our Photos' page, where I meticulously organized and
        stored data for efficient image loading from the database.
        Additionally, I contributed to the creation of the admin page,
        enabling the addition and management of training materials
        within the database. The technologies employed in this project
        encompassed{" "}
